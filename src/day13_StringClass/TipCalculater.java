        /*calculator.
                There will be different service quality benchmarks that will determine the
        tip given.
        There will also the ability to calculate based on the number of people in
        the party and if there is a split of the bill or not.
                Poor = 5%, Fair = 10%, Good = 15%, Great = 20%, Excellent
                = 25%
                The program should display the following information based on the
        user input:
        Split or No split (Yes or No),  Number of people entered: (number)
                (each person = & in output) Check amount: (number) Service Quality:
        (String) Total to pay: Total tip: Total per person: Tip per person:
        Ex:
        Split or No split (Yes or No)?
        Yes
        Enter the number of people
        4
        Enter the check amount:
        476
        How was the srvice quality?
                (Excellent/Great/Good/Fair/Poor)
        Excellent
        output:
        Number of people entered: 4
        Total to pay: 595.0
        Total tip: 119.0
        Total per person: 148.75
        Tip per person: 29.75
        HINT: you will need to use .equals() method*/
